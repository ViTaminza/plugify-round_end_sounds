// round_end_sounds — the map readiness gate of PITFALLS B1/B2, engine-free so the tests can drive
// every transition.
//
// s2sdk dereferences its client list and entity system only while a map is up: before the first
// map, and in the window between OnMapEnd and the next OnMapStart, any client query reads a
// torn-down list and crashes the server (handoff/weaponskins/PITFALLS.md B1/B2). Every client,
// entity and schema call of this plugin therefore asks Ready() first.
//
// The rules, exactly as src/plugin.cpp wires them to the s2sdk listeners:
//   * OnPluginStart   -> Reset(): a fresh start (including `plg reload`) begins with the gate shut.
//   * OnMapStart      -> OnMapStart(): the map and its client list exist, the gate opens.
//   * OnMapEnd        -> OnMapEnd(): only drops state; no client call may follow it (B2).
//   * OnPluginUpdate  -> OnPluginUpdate(): a plugin loaded (or reloaded) into a running map never
//                        saw OnMapStart, so its first update opens the gate - but only with the map
//                        listeners registered (without them nothing could ever close the gate
//                        again) and only when no OnMapEnd was seen since OnPluginStart (the host
//                        keeps pumping updates through a changelevel, so after an OnMapEnd only a
//                        new OnMapStart may reopen it).
//   * OnPluginEnd     -> Close(): the library is going away, a stale callback must not reach a
//                        client.
